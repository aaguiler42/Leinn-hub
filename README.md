# Leinn Hub 🚀

Leinn Hub is a project that was born during a hectic and exciting hackathon weekend with just four passionate individuals. Our mission was to create a platform that could bridge the gap between companies looking to support a scholarship fund and Leinn students. 🤝

## 📌 Project Overview

The challenge we faced was to create a platform that facilitates the connection between students and companies that contribute to the common scholarship fund. We aimed to make it easy for both students to find companies and for recruiters to discover passionate Leinners to join their teams.

## 💡 Why Leinn Hub?

The heart of our project lies in using artificial intelligence to facilitate connections between students and companies. It's not just about recommendations; it's about the entire process, from initial contact to the exchange of messages, with a little help from [Novel.sh](https://novel.sh/). 🧠✉️

## 🎯 Key Features

Here's what makes Leinn Hub stand out:

1. **Streamlined Recruitment**: We simplify the daunting and expensive process of recruiting Leinn students. The traditional cost of recruiting a student can easily reach 3000 euros and take months of interviews. With Leinn Hub, we drastically reduce the time and resources required.

2. **In-Depth Questions**: We ask the candidates in-depth questions.

3. **AI Analysis**: We employ AI to analyze the responses to these in-depth questions. The AI gives candidates a score from 0 to 10 based on the qualities required in LEINN.

4. **Comprehensive Candidate Analysis**: We provide recruiters with these scores together with an analysis of the candidate's answers to speed up their work.
